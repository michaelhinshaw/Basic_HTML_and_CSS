    <h1>The Trials of a DIY experimental electronic Musician</h1>
    <div>
      <h2>So much more than just learning how to play music</h2>
      <p>The learning curve for a DIY electronic musician is vast.  There is not
        only music theory and instrument practice, but a DIY musician must also
        learn sound design, mixing, mastering, marketing, music business aspects,
        and in some cases where the computer is prevalent, coding languages.</p>
